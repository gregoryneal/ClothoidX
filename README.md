# ClothoidX
Draw 2D clothoid curves, or build a spline using points and their tangent angle (G1 fitting) or using points, their tangent angles and their curvature values (G2 fitting). 

A clothoid (euler, cornu spiral) is a curve whose curvature varies linearly with respect to its arc length. In this repository I explore generation, segmentation, and interpolation of clothoids using methods described by various researchers. 

### Building clothoid segments given arc length, initial curvature and curvature derivative, or arc length and initial and final curvature:
